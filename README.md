# zordbase

**The software is under construction!**

This is a [WordBase](https://apkpure.com/wordbase-%E2%80%93-fun-word-search-battles-with-friends/com.wordbaseapp)-like game, called ZordBase.

WordBase was a fun android-game, which I played a lot myself.<br>
Sadly, it was closed for unprofitability.<br>
This is a tribute to WordBase, which I have developed to amuse myself.

For now, you can play against a computer in Finnish.

If you want to run the software now, you have to run both client and server side applications.<br>
Short instructions:

clone repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/rottabonus/zordbase
```

start backend 
```
$ cd zordbase
$ cd back
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
start frontend
```
$ cd zordbase
$ cd front
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Note that you have to have both running at the same time!
Then you can access the game in localhost:8080
